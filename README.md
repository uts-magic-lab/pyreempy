# PyREEM emulation in Python

This package provides PyREEM emulation in Python.
It allows PyREEM development with ipython.
It requires no installation: you can use it without installing PyREEM.

It is not a complete clone of PyREEM, but provides much of the core functionality.

To use:
    import PyREEM
    PyREEM.start()

If you have a PyREEM `py_main`, you can run it:
    import py_main
    py_main.main()
